# Cursor Non-Technical Blog Platform PRD

**Status**: approved

## Purpose and Overview
The Cursor Non-Technical Blog Platform aims to create a centralized knowledge-sharing hub focused on empowering non-technical roles in product development organizations to effectively use Cursor. This platform will facilitate the documentation and sharing of practical experiences, tips, and best practices for Cursor usage in non-technical contexts.

### Problems Solved
1. Limited resources for non-technical Cursor users
2. Scattered knowledge about Cursor usage in non-technical roles
3. Need for practical, role-specific examples and use cases
4. Lack of centralized knowledge sharing platform
