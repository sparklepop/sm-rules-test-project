# UI Rules Directory

This directory contains rules related to frontend development and user interface design, including:

- React components and patterns
- HTML structure and semantics
- CSS and styling guidelines
- Angular components (if applicable)
- General frontend development practices

Each rule in this directory should focus on specific UI/UX concerns and follow the standard .mdc file format. Rules should be stored in individual .mdc files with appropriate naming conventions (e.g., *-agent.mdc, *-auto.mdc, *-always.mdc).
